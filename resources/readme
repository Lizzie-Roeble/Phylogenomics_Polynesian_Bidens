# Resources

This directory contains supporting files for running and customizing the target capture workflow.  
These files are not part of the main pipeline scripts but provide reference material that can be reused or adapted.

## Contents

- **target_files**  
  Target sequence files used in probe design and downstream filtering.  
  Includes both the original target files and improved versions generated in this workflow.

- **name_lists**  
  Curated species/sample name lists for pilot datasets and filtering steps.  
  Useful for replicating the examples in the tutorial or adapting them to your own data.
